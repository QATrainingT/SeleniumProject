Is a Collection of Interfaces and classes which helps in storing and Processing the data efficiently.

List will implement List Interface
---
A List is ordered collection (sometimes called a sequence).Lists may contains
duplicate elements.
ArrayList-->Have Dynamic size where we can increase by adding and decrease by removing 
// can accept duplicate values //ArraList,LinkedList,vector- Implementing List interface
//array have fixed size where as arraylist can grow dynamicaly 
//you can access and insert any value in any index 
//Controlling the Order stored
LinkedList
Vector


Set will implement Set Interface
---
A Set is a Collection that cannot duplicate elements 
However it makes no Guarantees concerning order of iteration.
// cannot have accept duplicate values
// No Guarantee the elements stored in sequential Order and store in Random Order
HashSet
linkedHashSet
TreeSet

HashMap and HashTable
Key Value Pair
HashMap: Multiple programs accessing the hash map thread came to access Not thread safe and non synchronised, 
allows Null keys and Null Values
Uses Iterator Interfaces
HashTable: Thread safe means operation will be performed when other thread complete the Program and synchronised,
not allowed Null keys and Null values
Uses enumeration Interfaces

HashMap<Integer, String> hm = new HashMap<Integer, String>();
		hm.put(1, "Anil");
		hm.put(2, "Gottipati");
		hm.put(3, "Kumar");
		System.out.println(hm.get(1));
		
		Set sn=hm.entrySet();
		Iterator a=sn.iterator();
		while(a.hasNext())
		{
			Map.Entry mp=(Map.Entry)a.next();
			System.out.println(mp.getKey());
			System.out.println(mp.getValue());
		}
