Constructor:
Contructor is Called when ever an Object is created.
Will not return values and constructor name should be same as class name.
Compiler will call Implicit constructor if you have not defined constructor
If we want initiate the objects or defined variables , we will create constructor
So that no need to call , and all variables will be called automatically.

super:
Variable and Method:
--------
Super()- will refer to parent Class Variable when the same name displayed in Child also.
(First preference local)
If need to call the Parent constructor the insert Super() in first line in child constructor


This:
If one of the method required the Global variable along the local variable
this refers to the global variable and lies in class level.

A static method belongs to the class and a non-static method belongs to an object of a class.
Static methods are useful if you have only one instance where you're going to use the method
Sr. No.	Key	Static	Non-Static
1	Access	A static method can access only static members and can not access non-static members.	
A non-static method can access both static as well as non-static members.
2	Binding	
    Static method uses complie time binding or early binding.	
    Non-static method uses run time binding or dynamic binding.
3	Overriding	
    A static method cannot be overridden being compile time binding.
	A non-static method can be overridden being dynamic binding.
4	Memory allocation	
    Static method occupies less space and memory allocation happens once.	
    A non-static method may occupy more space. Memory allocation happens when method is invoked and memory is deallocated once method is executed completely.
5	Keyword	
    A static method is declared using static keyword.	A normal method is not required to have any special keyword.
